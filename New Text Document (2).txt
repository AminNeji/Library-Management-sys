--------Overview---------
This project is a Library Management System implemented in C. It provides functionalities to manage library members (adherents), documents (articles, books, and magazines), and borrowing transactions (emprunts). The system allows the addition, modification, listing, and searching of members and documents, as well as managing borrowing and return transactions.

--------Features----------
Member Management: Add, modify, list, search, and delete library members.
Document Management: Add, modify, list, search, and delete documents such as articles, books, and magazines.
Borrowing Management: Manage borrowing and returning of documents by members, track overdue items.

----------Data Structures-----------
adherant: Represents a library member with attributes such as name, address, and membership type.
date: Represents a date with day, month, and year.
localisation: Represents the location of a document within the library.
